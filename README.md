This script is responsible for downloading Sentinel 2 images within a defined time series and for certain areas that we define with assets. After processing the images, the files will be uploaded to Google Earth Engine. In addition, we will apply a cloud mask to the images to avoid downloading erroneous or unnecessary data.
